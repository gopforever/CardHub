# CardTrack â€¢ Netlify Starter (Vite + React + TypeScript + Tailwind)

A clean, interactive starter for a sports cards & TCG tracker. Local-first now, API-ready later.

## Run locally
```bash
npm i
npm run dev
```

## Build
```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## Deploy to Netlify
- Push this folder to GitHub, then "New site from Git" in Netlify, or
- Use the Netlify CLI, or
- (Advanced) Drag-and-drop the `dist` folder after building.

Serverless functions live in `netlify/functions` and are auto-wired.
